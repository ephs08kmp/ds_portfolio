# Street Crime in Baltimore: Narrative Analytics and Experimentation

Baltimore is a city that is infamous for high crime rates, being named the 7th most dangerous city in the United States in 2015, to having a record-breaking number of homicides per capita in 2017. This high rate of crime threatens economic development.  Reduction of crime in Baltimore is important to improve the quality of life for citizens, increase real estate values, and to boost the local economy. 

In an effort to try to reduce crime in Baltimore, data was taken from the [Baltimore Police Department](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/crime-in-baltimore) which represents victim based crime data.  This data is important to analyze to understand the city crime patterns and to implement efforts to stop crimes from happening in the first place. My initial analysis will analyze data for the entire city from 2012 to 2017.  I will identify patterns in order to zoom in on actions that could potentially impact the data, and then design an A/B test to identify the impact of that action on crime.

### Installation
Download the `BPD_Part_1_Victim_Based_Crime_Data.csv` file, above, or through the [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/crime-in-baltimore):

### Usage
