# Student Success Analytic Report and Research Proposal

Why do some students thrive in school and others struggle? Aside from differences in income, what factors contribute to greater student successes or failures?

In this project, I will be studying survey data that provides information about a student's life outside of school in order to determine relationships that might predict a student's drinking habits or grades.  This data is from students in a math or portuguese language course in secondary schools in Portugal. While the data is broken up into two separate datasets for the two courses, I will focus on the math class, the attributes of which focus on student background, parent background, student school data, student social data, and student grades.  I will focus my discussion on trends for the math class by topic.  

After analyzing the data, I will ask and answer questions using statistics and visualizations.  Following this analysis, I will propose further research that could delve deeper into the issues raised in this report.


### Installation
Download the `student-mat.csv` file, above, or through the [Kaggle Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption):

### Usage
Run all cells in the `Student_Success_Analytic_Report.ipynb` file using a jupyter notebook.

### Extending this
If you want to extend this work, here are a few places to start:
1.  Collect data for actual number for data points, not just a rating based on opinion.  For example, for alcohol consumption, a student could report the actual number of drinks during that period.  This would provide a more objective viewpoint, rather than the subjective rating that was given.  This could be done for the other subjective ratings of free time, and going out with friends too.
2. Collect this data over time to determine how factors change over time for each individual student and how this could impact their grade.  Without historical data, it is unclear if the correlations found in this data were because of past successes and failures, or from the student's current circumstance. Did having positive family relationships early in life help shape the student academically? Does childhood health correlate with higher scores later in life?
3. How does this data for these schools relate to the neighboring schools? Is this school representative of the population of this city or country? Or is this school doing particularly well? Do these students have similar outcomes as those in other schools? Are parents right to choose this school based on its reputation?
