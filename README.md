# Katherine Peterson's Data Science Portfolio
## Welcome

Welcome to my data science portfolio! In the folders above are various data science projects that showcase my skills in exploring, visualizing, analyzing, experimenting and modeling with data. Below is a brief overview of the various projects.  You can find more detail in each respective folder.

### [Crime in Baltimore](https://github.com/ephs08kmp/ds_portfolio/tree/master/Crime_in_Baltimore)
__Project Overview:__ Baltimore's high crime rate is a threat not only to its citizens, but its real estate values and its local economy.  This project analyzes victim-based crimes in Baltimore to identify patterns in the crime data.  This analysis is used to design an A/B experimental test in efforts to decrease street crimes.  

__Skills Showcased:__ EDA, Narrative Analytics, Experimental Design, A/B Test Design, Communication of Results

### [Income Demographics](https://github.com/ephs08kmp/ds_portfolio/tree/master/Income_demographics)
__Project Overview:__ Income disparities are of great concern to both individuals and coroporations.  This project analyzes census demographic data, which includes data about if a person's income was over or under \$50,000 for the year.  This analysis was then used to create features to identify the demographic indicators that would then be used in models to predict if a person would earn over or under \$50,000.  This analysis was then compared to men and women to determine how the factors differ between the two sexes. 

__Skills Showcased:__ EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Supervised Machine Learning, Communication of Results

### [NYT Decades](https://github.com/ephs08kmp/ds_portfolio/tree/master/NYT_decades)
__Project Overview:__ The world has changed since the 1960's, but has the way it has been reported in the media? This project analyzes New York Times texts from five different decades from 1960 to 2010.  After scraping and cleaning the texts, natural language processing techniques were used to extract information from the texts.  This information was then used to cluster texts and model the decade from which a text was written. 

__Skills Showcased:__ Natural Language Processing, Feature Engineering and Selection, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Supervised Machine Learning

### [Student Success](https://github.com/ephs08kmp/ds_portfolio/tree/master/Student_Success)
__Project Overview:__ The student acheivement gap impacts our future as a country because if students aren't succeeding, then neither will our future.  This project analyzes student survey and grade data from secondary schools in Portugal.  After exploring the data, questions are asked and answered to garner information about how the marital status of parents, living in a rural or urban setting, and  having more positive influences in their life relates to higher or lower achievement. 

__Skills Showcased:__ EDA, Inquisitivity, Statistics, Visualizations, Research Proposals
